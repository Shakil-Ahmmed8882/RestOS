## Main Features

1. **View All Food Items**
   - Users can browse through a list of available food items.

2. **View Single Item**

3. **Add a Food Item**
   - Users with the right permissions can add new food items to the database.

4. **Delete an Item**
   - Authorized users can remove food items from the database.

5. **Modify an Item**
